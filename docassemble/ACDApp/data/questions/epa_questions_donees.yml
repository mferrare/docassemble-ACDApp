question: How should your donees act?
subquestion: |
  You can nominate for your donees to make decisions together (jointly) or you can
  nominate for each of your donees to act independently of the other (jointly and severally).
  
  If your donees act jointly, it means both donees must come to the same decision, otherwise
  neither can act on your behalf.  If your donees act jointly and severally, then one doneee may
  make a decision without consulting the other donee first.
